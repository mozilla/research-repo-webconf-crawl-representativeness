This list contains the domains most frequently visited by the opt-in human users we studied.

The release consists of sites belonging to the top 10,000 of the
[Trexa10KU list](https://github.com/mozilla/trexa/blob/master/lists/tranco_10k_alexa_10k_union.csv),
ranked by frequency counts computed using differential privacy (epsilon = 0.7).
Domains with a DP frequency count of 0 or less have been dropped.
